Board game done in Global Game Jam 2017

First attempt in the game jam and in the life to make board game.

The development phases are captured by pictures and the digital version of board game design related files are provided in Affinity Design format.

If you are interested, you can grab all the files in pdf format and print it out to try the game. However, in the time of writing, rule is provided in Chinese only. The English version will be written and hopefully be on soon.
